"Check a local package and all of its dependencies for errors. This will "
"essentially compile the packages without performing the final step of code "
"generation, which is faster than running `cargo build`. The compiler will "
"save metadata files to disk so that future runs will reuse them if the "
"source has not been modified. Some diagnostics and errors are only emitted "
"during code generation, so they inherently won't be reported with `cargo "
"check`."
