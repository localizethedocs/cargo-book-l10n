msgid ""
"Cargo supports some forms of authentication when using git dependencies and "
"registries. This appendix contains some information for setting up git "
"authentication in a way that works with Cargo."

#: src/appendix/git-authentication.md:7
msgid ""
"If you need other authentication methods, the [`net.git-fetch-with-cli`](../"
"reference/config.md#netgit-fetch-with-cli) config value can be set to cause "
"Cargo to execute the `git` executable to handle fetching remote repositories "
"instead of using the built-in support. This can be enabled with the "
"`CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true` environment variable."

"HTTPS authentication requires the [`credential.helper`](https://git-scm.com/"
"book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage) mechanism. There are multiple "
"credential helpers, and you specify the one you want to use in your global "
"git configuration file."

"Cargo does not ask for passwords, so for most helpers you will need to give "
"the helper the initial username/password before running Cargo. One way to do "

"SSH authentication requires `ssh-agent` to be running to acquire the SSH "

"Windows can use Pageant (part of [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/"
"~sgtatham/putty/)) or `ssh-agent`. To use `ssh-agent`, Cargo needs to use "
"the OpenSSH that is distributed as part of Windows, as Cargo does not "
"support the simulated Unix-domain sockets used by MinGW or Cygwin. More "
"information about installing with Windows can be found at the [Microsoft "
"installation documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/"
"administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) and the page on [key "
