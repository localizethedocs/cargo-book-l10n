"Clearly documenting the features can set expectations about features that "

"When features are documented in the library API, this can make it easier for "
"your users to discover which features are available and what they do. If the "
"feature documentation for a package isn't readily available, you can look at "
"the `Cargo.toml` file, but sometimes it can be hard to track it down. The "
"crate page on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) has a link to the source "
"repository if available. Tools like [`cargo vendor`](../commands/cargo-"
"vendor.md) or [cargo-clone-crate](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-clone-"
"crate) can be used to download the source and inspect it."
