msgid ""
"Cargo supports some forms of authentication when using git dependencies and "
"registries. This appendix contains some information for setting up git "
"authentication in a way that works with Cargo."
msgstr ""

#: src/appendix/git-authentication.md:7
msgid ""
"If you need other authentication methods, the [`net.git-fetch-with-cli`](../"
"reference/config.md#netgit-fetch-with-cli) config value can be set to cause "
"Cargo to execute the `git` executable to handle fetching remote repositories "
"instead of using the built-in support. This can be enabled with the "
"`CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true` environment variable."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"HTTPS authentication requires the [`credential.helper`](https://git-scm.com/"
"book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage) mechanism. There are multiple "
"credential helpers, and you specify the one you want to use in your global "
"git configuration file."

"Cargo does not ask for passwords, so for most helpers you will need to give "
"the helper the initial username/password before running Cargo. One way to do "
"this is to run `git clone` of the private git repo and enter the username/"
"password."

"SSH authentication requires `ssh-agent` to be running to acquire the SSH "
"key. Make sure the appropriate environment variables are set up "
"(`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` on most Unix-like systems), and that the correct keys are "
"added (with `ssh-add`). Windows uses Pageant for SSH authentication."

"**Note:** SSH configuration files (like OpenSSH's `~/.ssh/config`) are not "
