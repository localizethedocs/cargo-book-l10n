#: src/faq.md:231
msgid ""
"A build script prints `cargo:rerun-if-changed=foo` where `foo` is a file "
"that doesn't exist and nothing generates it. In this case Cargo will keep "
"running the build script thinking it will generate the file but nothing ever "
"does. The fix is to avoid printing `rerun-if-changed` in this scenario."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:236
msgid ""
"Two successive Cargo builds may differ in the set of features enabled for "
"some dependencies. For example if the first build command builds the whole "
"workspace and the second command builds only one crate, this may cause a "
"dependency on crates.io to have a different set of features enabled, causing "
"it and everything that depends on it to get rebuilt. There's unfortunately "
"not really a great fix for this, although if possible it's best to have the "
"set of features enabled on a crate constant regardless of what you're "
"building in your workspace."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:245

"Some filesystems exhibit unusual behavior around timestamps. Cargo primarily "
"uses timestamps on files to govern whether rebuilding needs to happen, but "
"if you're using a nonstandard filesystem it may be affecting the timestamps "
"somehow (e.g. truncating them, causing them to drift, etc). In this "
"scenario, feel free to open an issue and we can see if we can accommodate "
"the filesystem somehow."

"A concurrent build process is either deleting artifacts or modifying files. "
"Sometimes you might have a background process that either tries to build or "
"check your project. These background processes might surprisingly delete "
"some build artifacts or touch files (or maybe just by accident), which can "
"cause rebuilds to look spurious! The best fix here would be to wrangle the "
"background process to avoid clashing with your work."
