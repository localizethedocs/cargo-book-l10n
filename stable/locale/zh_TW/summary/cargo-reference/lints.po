"`hint-mostly-unused` indicates that most of a crate's API surface will go "
"unused by anything depending on it; this hint can speed up the build by "
"attempting to minimize compilation time for items that aren't used at all. "
"Misapplication to crates that don't fit that criteria will slow down the "
"build rather than speeding it up. It should be selectively applied to "
"dependencies that meet these criteria. Applying it globally is always a "
"misapplication and will likely slow down the build."
