"By default, the `Cargo.lock` file that is included with the package will be "
"ignored. This means that Cargo will recompute which versions of dependencies "
"to use, possibly using newer versions that have been released since the "
"package was published. The `--locked` flag can be used to force Cargo to use "
"the packaged `Cargo.lock` file if it is available. This may be useful for "
"ensuring reproducible builds, to use the exact same set of dependencies that "
"were available when the package was published. It may also be useful if a "
"newer version of a dependency is published that no longer builds on your "
"system, or has other problems. The downside to using `--locked` is that you "
"will not receive any fixes or updates to any dependency. Note that Cargo did "
"not start publishing `Cargo.lock` files until version 1.37, which means "
"packages published with prior versions will not have a `Cargo.lock` file "
"available."
