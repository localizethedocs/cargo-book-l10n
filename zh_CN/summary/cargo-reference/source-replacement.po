"Cargo has a core assumption about source replacement that the source code is "

"As a consequence, source replacement is not appropriate for situations such "
"as patching a dependency or a private registry. Cargo supports patching "

"Registries chapter](registries.md)."

"When using source replacement, running commands like `cargo publish` that "
