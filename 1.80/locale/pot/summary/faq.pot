msgid "Is the plan to use GitHub as a package repository?"
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:5
msgid ""
"No. The plan for Cargo is to use [crates.io](https://crates.io/), like npm "
"or Rubygems do with [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) and [rubygems.org]"
"(https://rubygems.org)."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:8
msgid ""
"We plan to support git repositories as a source of packages forever, because "
"they can be used for early development and temporary patches, even when "
"people use the registry as the primary source of packages."

msgid "Why build crates.io rather than use GitHub as a registry?"
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:14
msgid ""
"We think that it’s very important to support multiple ways to download "
"packages, including downloading from GitHub and copying packages into your "
"package itself."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:18
msgid ""
"That said, we think that [crates.io](https://crates.io/) offers a number of "
"important benefits, and will likely become the primary way that people "
"download packages in Cargo."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:21
msgid ""
"For precedent, both Node.js’s [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and Ruby’s "
"[bundler](https://bundler.io) support both a central registry model as well "
"as a Git-based model, and most packages are downloaded through the registry "
"in those ecosystems, with an important minority of packages making use of "
"git-based packages."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:30
msgid ""
"Some of the advantages that make a central registry popular in other "
"languages include:"
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:33
msgid ""
"**Discoverability**. A central registry provides an easy place to look for "
"existing packages. Combined with tagging, this also makes it possible for a "
"registry to provide ecosystem-wide information, such as a list of the most "
"popular or most-depended-on packages."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:37
msgid ""
"**Speed**. A central registry makes it possible to easily fetch just the "
"metadata for packages quickly and efficiently, and then to efficiently "
"download just the published package, and not other bloat that happens to "
"exist in the repository. This adds up to a significant improvement in the "
"speed of dependency resolution and fetching. As dependency graphs scale up, "
"downloading all of the git repositories bogs down fast. Also remember that "
"not everybody has a high-speed, low-latency Internet connection."

msgid "Yes!"
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:50
msgid ""
"Cargo handles compiling Rust code, but we know that many Rust packages link "
"against C code. We also know that there are decades of tooling built up "
"around compiling languages other than Rust."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:54
msgid ""
"Our solution: Cargo allows a package to [specify a script](reference/build-"
"scripts.md) (written in Rust) to run before invoking `rustc`. Rust is "
"leveraged to implement platform-specific configuration and refactor out "
"common build functionality among packages."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:59
msgid "Can Cargo be used inside of `make` (or `ninja`, or ...)"
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:61
msgid ""
"Indeed. While we intend Cargo to be useful as a standalone way to compile "
"Rust packages at the top-level, we know that some people will want to invoke "
"Cargo from other build tools."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:65
msgid ""
"We have designed Cargo to work well in those contexts, paying attention to "
"things like error codes and machine-readable output modes. We still have "
"some work to do on those fronts, but using Cargo in the context of "
"conventional scripts is something we designed for from the beginning and "
"will continue to prioritize."

msgid "Does Cargo handle multi-platform packages or cross-compilation?"
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:73

"Rust itself provides facilities for configuring sections of code based on "

msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:110
msgid ""
"The purpose of a `Cargo.lock` lockfile is to describe the state of the world "
"at the time of a successful build. Cargo uses the lockfile to provide "

msgid "Why `Cargo.toml`?"
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:159
msgid ""
"As one of the most frequent interactions with Cargo, the question of why the "
"configuration file is named `Cargo.toml` arises from time to time. The "
"leading capital-`C` was chosen to ensure that the manifest was grouped with "
"other similar configuration files in directory listings. Sorting files often "
"puts capital letters before lowercase letters, ensuring files like "
"`Makefile` and `Cargo.toml` are placed together. The trailing `.toml` was "
"chosen to emphasize the fact that the file is in the [TOML configuration "
"format](https://toml.io/)."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:168
msgid ""
"Cargo does not allow other names such as `cargo.toml` or `Cargofile` to "
"emphasize the ease of how a Cargo repository can be identified. An option of "
"many possible names has historically led to confusion where one case was "
"handled but others were accidentally forgotten."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:175
msgid "How can Cargo work offline?"
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:177
msgid ""
"Cargo is often used in situations with limited or no network access such as "
"airplanes, CI environments, or embedded in large production deployments. "
"Users are often surprised when Cargo attempts to fetch resources from the "
"network, and hence the request for Cargo to work offline comes up frequently."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:182
msgid ""
"Cargo, at its heart, will not attempt to access the network unless told to "
"do so. That is, if no crates come from crates.io, a git repository, or some "
"other network location, Cargo will never attempt to make a network "
"connection. As a result, if Cargo attempts to touch the network, then it's "
"because it needs to fetch a required resource."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:188
msgid ""
"Cargo is also quite aggressive about caching information to minimize the "
"amount of network activity. It will guarantee, for example, that if `cargo "
"build` (or an equivalent) is run to completion then the next `cargo build` "
"is guaranteed to not touch the network so long as `Cargo.toml` has not been "
"modified in the meantime. This avoidance of the network boils down to a "
"`Cargo.lock` existing and a populated cache of the crates reflected in the "
"lock file. If either of these components are missing, then they're required "
"for the build to succeed and must be fetched remotely."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:197
msgid ""
"As of Rust 1.11.0, Cargo understands a new flag, `--frozen`, which is an "
"assertion that it shouldn't touch the network. When passed, Cargo will "
"immediately return an error if it would otherwise attempt a network request. "
"The error should include contextual information about why the network "
"request is being made in the first place to help debug as well. Note that "
"this flag _does not change the behavior of Cargo_, it simply asserts that "
"Cargo shouldn't touch the network as a previous command has been run to "
"ensure that network activity shouldn't be necessary."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:206
msgid ""
"The `--offline` flag was added in Rust 1.36.0. This flag tells Cargo to not "
"access the network, and try to proceed with available cached data if "
"possible. You can use [`cargo fetch`](commands/cargo-fetch.md) in one "
"project to download dependencies before going offline, and then use those "
"same dependencies in another project with the `--offline` flag (or "
"[configuration value](reference/config.md#netoffline))."

msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:221
msgid ""
"Cargo is responsible for incrementally compiling crates in your project. "

"We've long [wanted to provide better diagnostics about this](https://github."

"debug a rebuild at least a little by setting the `CARGO_LOG` environment "
"variable:"
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:236
msgid ""
"This will cause Cargo to print out a lot of information about diagnostics "
"and rebuilding. This can often contain clues as to why your project is "
"getting rebuilt, although you'll often need to connect some dots yourself "
"since this output isn't super easy to read just yet. Note that the "
"`CARGO_LOG` needs to be set for the command that rebuilds when you think it "
"should not. Unfortunately Cargo has no way right now of after-the-fact "
"debugging \"why was that rebuilt?\""

"Some issues we've seen historically which can cause crates to get rebuilt "

msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:245
msgid ""
"A build script prints `cargo::rerun-if-changed=foo` where `foo` is a file "
"that doesn't exist and nothing generates it. In this case Cargo will keep "
"running the build script thinking it will generate the file but nothing ever "
"does. The fix is to avoid printing `rerun-if-changed` in this scenario."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:250
msgid ""
"Two successive Cargo builds may differ in the set of features enabled for "
"some dependencies. For example if the first build command builds the whole "
"workspace and the second command builds only one crate, this may cause a "
"dependency on crates.io to have a different set of features enabled, causing "
"it and everything that depends on it to get rebuilt. There's unfortunately "
"not really a great fix for this, although if possible it's best to have the "
"set of features enabled on a crate constant regardless of what you're "
"building in your workspace."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:259
msgid ""
"Some filesystems exhibit unusual behavior around timestamps. Cargo primarily "
"uses timestamps on files to govern whether rebuilding needs to happen, but "
"if you're using a nonstandard filesystem it may be affecting the timestamps "
"somehow (e.g. truncating them, causing them to drift, etc). In this "
"scenario, feel free to open an issue and we can see if we can accommodate "
"the filesystem somehow."
msgstr ""

#: src/faq.md:266
msgid ""
"A concurrent build process is either deleting artifacts or modifying files. "
"Sometimes you might have a background process that either tries to build or "
"check your project. These background processes might surprisingly delete "
"some build artifacts or touch files (or maybe just by accident), which can "
"cause rebuilds to look spurious! The best fix here would be to wrangle the "
"background process to avoid clashing with your work."
