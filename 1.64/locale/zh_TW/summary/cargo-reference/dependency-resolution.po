"Follow the [SemVer guidelines](semver.md) when deciding how to update your "
"version number, and whether or not you will need to make a SemVer-"
"incompatible version change."
msgstr ""

#: src/reference/resolver.md:443
msgid ""
"Use caret requirements for dependencies, such as `\"1.2.3\"`, for most "
"situations. This ensures that the resolver can be maximally flexible in "
"choosing a version while maintaining build compatibility."
msgstr ""

#: src/reference/resolver.md:446
msgid ""
"Specify all three components with the version you are currently using. This "
"helps set the minimum version that will be used, and ensures that other "
"users won't end up with an older version of the dependency that might be "
"missing something that your package requires."
msgstr ""

#: src/reference/resolver.md:450
msgid ""
"Avoid `*` requirements, as they are not allowed on [crates.io](https://"
"crates.io/), and they can pull in SemVer-breaking changes during a normal "
"`cargo update`."
msgstr ""

#: src/reference/resolver.md:452
msgid ""
"Avoid overly broad version requirements. For example, `>=2.0.0` can pull in "
"any SemVer-incompatible version, like version `5.0.0`, which can result in "
"broken builds in the future."
msgstr ""

#: src/reference/resolver.md:455
msgid ""
"Avoid overly narrow version requirements if possible. For example, if you "
"specify a tilde requirement like `bar=\"~1.3\"`, and another package "
"specifies a requirement of `bar=\"1.4\"`, this will fail to resolve, even "
"though minor releases should be compatible."
msgstr ""

#: src/reference/resolver.md:459
msgid ""
"Try to keep the dependency versions up-to-date with the actual minimum "
"versions that your library requires. For example, if you have a requirement "
"of `bar=\"1.0.12\"`, and then in a future release you start using new "
"features added in the `1.1.0` release of \"bar\", update your dependency "
"requirement to `bar=\"1.1.0\"`."

#: src/reference/resolver.md:465

"If you fail to do this, it may not be immediately obvious because Cargo can "
"opportunistically choose the newest version when you run a blanket `cargo "
"update`. However, if another user depends on your library, and runs `cargo "
"update -p your-library`, it will _not_ automatically update \"bar\" if it is "
"locked in their `Cargo.lock`. It will only update \"bar\" in that situation "
"if the dependency declaration is also updated. Failure to do so can cause "
"confusing build errors for the user using `cargo update -p`."

"If two packages are tightly coupled, then an `=` dependency requirement may "
"help ensure that they stay in sync. For example, a library with a companion "
"proc-macro library will sometimes make assumptions between the two libraries "
"that won't work well if the two are out of sync (and it is never expected to "
"use the two libraries independently). The parent library can use an `=` "
"requirement on the proc-macro, and re-export the macros for easy access."
