"There are multiple sources from which a crate can be installed. The default "
"location is crates.io but the `--git`, `--path`, and `--registry` flags can "
"change this source. If the source contains more than one package (such as "
"crates.io or a git repository with multiple crates) the _crate_ argument is "
"required to indicate which crate should be installed."

"Crates from crates.io can optionally specify the version they wish to "
"install via the `--version` flags, and similarly packages from git "
"repositories can optionally specify the branch, tag, or revision that should "
"be installed. If a crate has multiple binaries, the `--bin` argument can "
"selectively install only one of them, and if you'd rather install examples "
"the `--example` argument can be used as well."

"If the source is crates.io or `--git` then by default the crate will be "

"By default, the `Cargo.lock` file that is included with the package will be "
"ignored. This means that Cargo will recompute which versions of dependencies "
"to use, possibly using newer versions that have been released since the "
"package was published. The `--locked` flag can be used to force Cargo to use "
"the packaged `Cargo.lock` file if it is available. This may be useful for "
"ensuring reproducible builds, to use the exact same set of dependencies that "
"were available when the package was published. It may also be useful if a "
"newer version of a dependency is published that no longer builds on your "
"system, or has other problems. The downside to using `--locked` is that you "
"will not receive any fixes or updates to any dependency. Note that Cargo did "
"not start publishing `Cargo.lock` files until version 1.37, which means "
"packages published with prior versions will not have a `Cargo.lock` file "
"available."
