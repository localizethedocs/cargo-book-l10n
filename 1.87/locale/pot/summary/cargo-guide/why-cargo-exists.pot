"In Rust, as you may know, a library or executable program is called a "
"[_crate_](../appendix/glossary.md#crate \"\\\"crate\\\" (glossary entry)\"). "
"Crates are compiled using the Rust compiler, `rustc`. When starting with "
"Rust, the first source code most people encounter is that of the classic "
"“hello world” program, which they compile by invoking `rustc` directly:"

"Note that the above command required that you specify the file name "
"explicitly. If you were to directly use `rustc` to compile a different "
"program, a different command line invocation would be required. If you "
"needed to specify any specific compiler flags or include external "
"dependencies, then the needed command would be even more specific (and "
"complex)."

"Furthermore, most non-trivial programs will likely have dependencies on "
"external libraries, and will therefore also depend transitively on _their_ "
"dependencies. Obtaining the correct versions of all the necessary "
"dependencies and keeping them up to date would be hard and error-prone if "
"done by hand."

"Rather than work only with crates and `rustc`, you can avoid the "
"difficulties involved with performing the above tasks by introducing a "
"higher-level [\"_package_\"](../appendix/glossary.md#package \"\\\"package\\"
"\" (glossary entry)\") abstraction and by using a [_package manager_](../"
"appendix/glossary.md#package-manager \"\\\"package manager\\\" (glossary "

"_Cargo_ is the Rust package manager. It is a tool that allows Rust "
"[_packages_](../appendix/glossary.md#package \"\\\"package\\\" (glossary "
"entry)\") to declare their various dependencies and ensure that you’ll "
"always get a repeatable build."

"To a large extent, Cargo normalizes the commands needed to build a given "
"program or library; this is one aspect to the above mentioned conventions. "
"As we show later, the same command can be used to build different "
"[_artifacts_](../appendix/glossary.md#artifact \"\\\"artifact\\\" (glossary "
"entry)\"), regardless of their names. Rather than invoke `rustc` directly, "
"you can instead invoke something generic such as `cargo build` and let cargo "
"worry about constructing the correct `rustc` invocation. Furthermore, Cargo "
"will automatically fetch any dependencies you have defined for your artifact "
"from a [_registry_](../appendix/glossary.md#registry \"\\\"registry\\"
"\" (glossary entry)\"), and arrange for them to be added into your build as "
"needed."
