"For example, the `foo` crate published version `1.5.0` and another crate "
"`bar` declared a dependency on version `foo = \"1.5\"`. Now `foo` releases a "
"new, but not semver compatible, version `2.0.0`, and finds a critical issue "
"with `1.5.0`. If `1.5.0` is yanked, no new project or checkout without an "
"existing lockfile will be able to use crate `bar` as it relies on `1.5`."
msgstr ""

#: src/commands/cargo-yank.md:36
msgid ""
"In this case, the maintainers of `foo` should first publish a semver "
"compatible version such as `1.5.1` prior to yanking `1.5.0` so that `bar` "
"and all projects that depend on `bar` will continue to work."

"Crates should only be yanked in exceptional circumstances, for example, an "
"accidental publish, an unintentional SemVer breakages, or a significantly "
"broken and unusable crate. In the case of security vulnerabilities, [RustSec]"
"(https://rustsec.org/) is typically a less disruptive mechanism to inform "
"users and encourage them to upgrade, and avoids the possibility of "
"significant downstream disruption irrespective of susceptibility to the "
"vulnerability in question."

"A common workflow is to yank a crate having already published a semver "

"When addressing copyright, licensing, or personal data issues with a "

"If credentials have been leaked, the recommended course of action is to "
"revoke them immediately. Once a crate has been published, it is impossible "
"to determine if the leaked credentials have been copied. Yanking the crate "
"only prevents new users from downloading it, but cannot stop those who have "
"already downloaded it from keeping or even spreading the leaked credentials."
