"Cargo supports some forms of authentication when using git dependencies and "

"If you need other authentication methods, the [`net.git-fetch-with-cli`](../"
"reference/config.md#netgit-fetch-with-cli) config value can be set to cause "
"Cargo to execute the `git` executable to handle fetching remote repositories "
"instead of using the built-in support. This can be enabled with the "

"standard locations (`.ssh/known_hosts` in your home directory, or `/etc/ssh/"
"ssh_known_hosts` on Unix-like platforms or `%PROGRAMDATA%"
"\\ssh\\ssh_known_hosts` on Windows). More information about these files can "
"be found in the [sshd man page](https://man.openbsd.org/"

"When connecting to an SSH host before the known hosts has been configured, "
"Cargo will display an error message instructing you how to add the host key. "
"This also includes a \"fingerprint\", which is a smaller hash of the host "
"key, which should be easier to visually verify. The server administrator can "
"get the fingerprint by running `ssh-keygen` against the public key (for "
"example, `ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub`). Well-known "
