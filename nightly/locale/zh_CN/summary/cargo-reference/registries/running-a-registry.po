"A minimal registry can be implemented by having a git repository that "
"contains an index, and a server that contains the compressed `.crate` files "
"created by [`cargo package`](../commands/cargo-package.md). Users won't be "
"able to use Cargo to publish to it, but this may be sufficient for closed "
"environments. The index format is described in [Registry Index](registry-"
"index.md)."
