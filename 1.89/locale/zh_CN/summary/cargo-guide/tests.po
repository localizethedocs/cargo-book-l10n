"Cargo can run your tests with the `cargo test` command. Cargo looks for "
"tests to run in two places: in each of your `src` files and any tests in "
"`tests/`. Tests in your `src` files should be unit tests and [documentation "
"tests](../../rustdoc/write-documentation/documentation-tests.html). Tests in "
"`tests/` should be integration-style tests. As such, you’ll need to import "
"your crates into the files in `tests`."
